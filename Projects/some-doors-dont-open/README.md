# Some Doors Don't Open 🎮

*A survival narrative game built in Scratch.*

## 🧠 Overview
**Some Doors Don’t Open** is an original, story-driven survival game where you control a character named Monet in a mysterious, high-stakes environment. Your mission is simple: reach randomly moving doors while avoiding bouncing laser hazards — and survive for 120 seconds. But not everything is as it seems.

The game explores choice, hope, and futility through minimalist gameplay and emotional design.
